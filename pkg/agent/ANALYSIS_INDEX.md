## Implementation Recommendations

### For Immediate Action (This Sprint)
1. Read ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.txt for overview
2. Review REFACTORING_GUIDE.md "Phase 1"
3. Rename 9 duplicate filenames
4. Move 4 agent-like tools from tools/ to agents/

### For Planning (Next Sprint)
1. Read CODE_STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md in full
2. Plan REFACTORING_GUIDE.md "Phase 2 and 3" changes
3. Schedule documentation work (Phase 4)
4. Plan testing strategy for each phase

### For Developer Reference
- Keep CODE_STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md as reference during refactoring
- Use REFACTORING_GUIDE.md as checklist
- Update ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.txt after each phase
